## What is the right to repair movement and why does it matter?

The right to repair movement is a group of people who believe that electronics nowadays are considered disposable. You are supposed to use for two or three years and replace it with a new device whenever it breaks or becomes obsolete. The right to repair movement believe that all electronics should be able to be worked on and repaired by other third party sources instead of just that companies own repair shops. This is important because now companies are taking measures to make electronics less workable for the end user. Such as apple installing their own screw in the IPhones just to force people to go to apple service stations to fix their devices. This movement affects everyone because this will mean devices that last for shorter amounts of time and are not repairable without spending more money at those companies repair shops.
